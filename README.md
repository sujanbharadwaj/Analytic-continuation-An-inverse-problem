# Analytic-continuation-An-inverse-problem
Presents results for the ill-posed problem of analytic continuation using noisy Quantum Monte Carlo data. This repository details two approaches: the traditional Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) and machine learning. A resource for researchers seeking to understand and develop new techniques for this challenge.
